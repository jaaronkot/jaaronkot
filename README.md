### About Me
Hello everyone, my name is Jaaron Kot, and I am an audio and video development engineer with extensive experience in WebRTC, live streaming, short video, and graphic processing.

I am proficient in various programming languages, including C++, Java, Objective-C, Python, and JavaScript, and have developed on multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, MacOS, and Linux.

I have initiated the [PixPark](https://github.com/pixpark) open-source organization, which focuses on developing and sharing open-source projects related to audio and video, such as our image filter library [GPUPixel](https://github.com/pixpark/gpupixel).
